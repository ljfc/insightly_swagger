  # unit tests for get_relationships
  # Gets a list of Relationships
  # This read only endpoint returns a list of the relationships that have been defined for the Insightly instance.            Relationships enable users to define how one Insightly object is related to another.            For example: contact A is a customer of contact B. The API only supports read access to relationships, to create or update            relationships, you&#39;ll need to do so via the web app.
