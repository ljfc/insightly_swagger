  # Gets a list of Opportunity State Reasons
  # This endpoint returns a list of opportunity state reasons set up for the Insightly instance.            This is a read only endpoint, so to add or update opportunity state reasons, you will need to do that via the web app.            Opportunity state reasons are used to indicate why the opportunity state was set to its current value.            For example, you can use this to indicate why you lost a particular sale.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :skip Optional, number of states to skip.
  # @option opts [Integer] :top Optional, maximum number of states to return in the response.
  # @option opts [BOOLEAN] :count_total Optional, true if total number of records should be returned in the response headers.
  # @return [Array<InlineResponse20027>]
